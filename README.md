# COMP603-Project
 
This is a semester long project assignment for COMP603 - Program Design and Construction. This project is a Java program meant to represent a customer facing self-serve kiosk at a ski resort. User's have the ability to purchase lift passes to access the mountain's slopes as well as top-up their "Mountain Card" credit and rent equipment. The program also allows users to order food and beverages from a menu of items at the Mountain Cafe, with the cost deducted from their Mountain Card's credit. There are CUI and GUI versions of this program constructed in the first and second halves of the semester.
